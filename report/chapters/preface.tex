A huge project like a master thesis is never done alone, and I have many people to thank for their contributions.
First, I would like to express my gratitude to my Professor Armin Wittneben for giving me the opportunity to work on this master thesis at the Wireless Communication Group.

I am also grateful to Yahia Hassan, my supervisor, for his help and guidance throughout the thesis. 
Yahia knew when he had to push me and when I needed a break to talk about football.
I also would like to thank him for letting me be part of submitting a scientific paper, and for sharing his insights on that process.

I owe many thanks to Dr. David Adjiashvili from the institute for operation research on his help with nonconvex optimizations, and for his advice during lunch breaks.
Further, I want to thank Dr. Katherine Caves for proofreading this thesis and for her advice on scientific writing, even when I was on a tight schedule.

Finally, all my love and thanks go to my family, to Laura, and to my flat mates.
Mom, Dad, Martin, and Manuel, thank you for your interest in my thesis and its progress.
Frederik, Philipp, and Stefan, thank you for getting my mind off the thesis when I came home.
Laura, thank you for your love, and for your support during the last six months.
