I would like to thank Professor Wittneben for giving me the opportunity to work on this master thesis at the Wireless Communication Group.
Further, I want to thank Yahia Hassan, my supervisor, for his help and guidance throughout the thesis.
Finally I want to thank David Adjiashvili for his inputs on the gradient search and heuristic solvers and Katie Caves for the proofreading.
