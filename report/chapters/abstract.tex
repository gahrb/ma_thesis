In nowadays wireless networks there are mainly two factors witch limit the achievable transmission rates - fading and interference.
When multiple-input-multiple-output MIMO systems mostly reduce the impact of fading, the problem of interference has not yet been solved satisfyingly.
The most common methods to address the problem of interference are protocols based on schemes like time-division-~(TDMA), frequency-division-~(FDMA), or code-division multiple access (CDMA).
The solution - but in the same time also the downside of those schemes - is the unique allocation of a specific time and/or frequency slot for a single user, hence the blocking of all other users.
This effect appears in the pre-logarithmic disproportional factor of the achievable sum rate.
\paragraph{}
In this thesis we address the problem of interference by the use of passive relay antennas (short: passive relays), i.e. antennas with only passive, lossless impedances attached, which interact with the receiving antennas only by the effect of coupling.
By the choice of the passive elements the effect of the coupling can be changed and by using multiple passive relays, the coupling can be used to increase the signal- and reduce the interference power at the receivers.
\paragraph{}
In the following, a new description of the system will be derived, which allows an easier, more elegant way of analyzing the effect of coupling.
Different solver methods are analyzed and discussed in order to find an optimal choice of the relay impedances.
As some of the solvers are based on the method of gradient search, the analytical gradient will be derived.
For the gradient search method, a variety of initial value choices will be compared to each other.
Further, the results are evaluated and compared to previously known methods.
