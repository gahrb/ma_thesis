\chapter{System Description}
\label{sec:system}

In the following the system will be described.
Figure~\ref{fig:system} gives an overview of it.
The transmitters on the left are assumed to be widely spaced, so that they experience no coupling among each other.
The signals are transmittet over a spatial interference channel, therefore a transmitted signal reaches every receiver.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/System.png}
\caption{Overview of the system.}
\label{fig:system}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Besides the receivers themselves, there are passive relays on the right side.
The relays and the receivers are closely spaced, therefore the channels between a transmitter and the receivers and relays are spatially correlated and the elements on the receiver side experience coupling among each other.

\section{Spatial Channel}
\label{sec:spatial}

As mentioned in the previous section the spatial channel is generated by spatial correlation among the receivers and the relays, dependent on the distance.
The correlation matrix is generated by the Besselfuntion according to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spatial_corr}
\mat{R}_{i,j} = B(2\cdot d_{i,j}\cdot \pi,0),
\end{equation}
where $B(d,0)$ is the 0-th Besselfunction~\cite[p.191]{Kreyszig} and $d_{i,j}$ the distance between the i-th and j-th receiving element (receive antennas and relays concatenated).
Therefore $\mat{R}$ is symmetric and 1 on its diagonal, as $B(0,0)=1$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/antennae_position.png}
\caption{Example of the receive antenna and the relay placing.}
\label{fig:antenna_placing}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The spatial channel from $n$-th transmitter to all receivers an relays is then generated by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spatial_channel}
\mat{H}_{n}^{\text{sp}} = \mat{R}^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot\mat{\Delta}_n,
\end{equation} 
where $\mat{\Delta}_n$ is a matrix of size $N_{\text{User}}\cdot \left(N_\text{Rx} + N_\text{Rel}\right) \times N_\text{Tx}$, with complex elements drawn from the standard normal distribution ($\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$).
Therefore $\mat{H}_{n}^{\text{sp}}$ is of size $N_{\text{User}}\cdot \left(N_\text{Rx} + N_\text{Rel}\right) \times N_\text{Tx}$.


\section{Receiver Circuit Description}
\label{sec:network_description}
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:SoA}, the idea of describing the receiver circuitry is based on the work of~\cite{Nossek}.
To do so, we represent each receiver block (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:receiver}) by n-ports.
A short overview on 2-ports (simplified n-ports) is given in the following.

\subsection{Multi-Port Networks}
\label{sec:multiport_networks}

In the following a 2-port network will be analyzed.
Later this can be easily extended to a multi-port network.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/twoport.png}
\caption{A twoport network~\cite{magnus:twoport}.}
\label{fig:twoport}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:twoport} shows a 2-port network.
The two-port network can be represented by an impedance matrix $\mat{Z}$.
The elements $Z_{ij}$ of the matrix are defined in the following way:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:multiport_impedance}
Z_{ij} &= \frac{V_i}{I_j},\\\nonumber
&\text{for the currents}\quad I_l = 0,\quad l\neq j.
\end{align}
Therefore the 2-port's input/output relations can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:twoport_io}
\begin{bmatrix}
V_1\\V_2
\end{bmatrix} &= \mat{Z} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
I_1\\I_2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

For a multi-port network, elements the voltages and currents can be represented as vectors on length $n$, and the elements $Z_{ij},\quad i,j\in\{1,2\}$ become sub matrices.
Looking from the left into the network with loads $R_L$ attached to the ports on the right, the equivalent input impedance matrix becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq_imp_load}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eq}_1} = \mat{Z}_{11} - \mat{Z}_{21}\cdot(\mat{Z}_{22} + R_L\cdot\mat{I})^{-1}\cdot \mat{Z}_{12}.
\end{equation}
With no load attached on port two (open circuited ports, or $R_L\rightarrow\infty$), the equivalent input impedance becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq_imp_oc}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eq}_1} = \mat{Z}_{11}.
\end{equation}
Last, having port one short-circuited (i.e.  $R_L\rightarrow 0$) and looking from port two into the network, the equivalent network impedance becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq_imp_sc}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eq}_2} = \mat{Z}_{22} - \mat{Z}_{12}\cdot(\mat{Z}_{11})^{-1}\cdot \mat{Z}_{21}.
\end{equation}
For reciprocal networks (\textit{RLC}-Networks, containing only passive elements), following property holds: $\mat{Z}_{12} = \mat{Z}_{21}^T$.

\subsection{Receiver Blocks}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/Receiver.png}
\caption{The receiver, with the coupling network $\mat{Z}_\text{C}$, the SP-matching network $\mat{Z}_\text{M}$, the LNA, and loads attached to the LNA.}
\label{fig:receiver}
\end{figure}
The receiver (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:receiver}) consists of three blocks.
From left to right:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{the coupling network ($\mat{Z}_\text{C}$),}
\item{the matching network ($\mat{Z}_\text{M}$), and}
\item{the low-noise-amplifier ($\mat{LNA}$).}
\end{enumerate}
 
All these blocks can be described in multi-port networks.
In the following each block will be discussed.

\subsubsection{The Coupling Network}
\label{sec:coupling_network}
The coupling network is introduced, as a compact antenna spacing is assumed on the receiver side.
The strength of the coupling between two antennas depends on the spacing between the antennas.
As the effect of coupling from one antenna to another is the same like the reverse, the impedance matrix $\mat{Z}_\text{C}$ becomes symmetric.
The coupling among the antennas is calculated by the "EWA"-Toolbox for MATLAB~\cite{Orfanidis}.
The theory of it can be found in~\cite[Chapter 23]{Orfanidis}.

\subsubsection{The Matching Network}
\label{sec:matching_network}
In order to improve the performance of the receiver, a matching network is placed after each receiving antenna.
For complexity and bandwith reasons, single-port (SP) matching is assumed~\cite{Yahia2013}.
The matching network has the form of 
\begin{equation}
\mat{Z}_\text{M}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mat{Z}_\text{M11} & \mat{Z}_\text{M12} \\
\mat{Z}_\text{M21} & \mat{Z}_\text{M22}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
For a matching network to be lossles it must be pure imaginary and symmetric~\cite{Nossek}.
Because we assume SP matching the submatrices become diagonal, with the choice of a reciprocal network, additionally following property holds: $\mat{Z}_\text{M12} = \mat{Z}_\text{M21}^T \implies \mat{Z}_\text{M12} = \mat{Z}_\text{M21}$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/T-Network.png}
\caption{Schematic of a reciprocal T-network.}
\label{fig:t_netw}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Low-Noise-Amplifier}
\label{sec:lna}
In the LNA-block the received signal after the matching network gets amplified.
As in the matchig network the LNA can be represented in the following way
\begin{equation}
\mat{LNA}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mat{c} & \mat{d} \\
\mat{e} & \mat{g}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
As each branch has it's own LNA, the submatrices $\mat{c},\mat{e}\text{ and }\mat{g}$ are again diagonal.
Additionally, matrix $\mat{d}$ is an all-zeros matrix if the unilateral assumtion (\textit{the input of the LNA is not affected by the output of the LNA}) is applied.




\subsection{Port Reduction}
\label{sec:port_reduction}

In the following we describe the open circuit reduction of a system like in Figure~\ref{fig:port_reduction}.
We do the port reduction, because we are interested in the signal only at the loads of the corresponding receiver (here receiver "0").
The signal picked up at relay antennae or not considered receivers contributes to the considered receiver by the coupling between the antennas, as described in Section~\ref{sec:coupling_network}.
The passive relays are modeled by connecting an impedance directly to the coupling network as shown in the lowest 2 branches on the left in Figure~\ref{fig:port_reduction}.
Undesired receivers can be equivalently modeled, however in this case the load corresponds to the equivalent input impedance of the matching network (as in Equation~\eqref{eq:zeqm1}) shown by the third lowest branch on the left.
In the following, $\vec{v}_\text{C}$ denotes the voltages on the ports between the coupling matrix $\mat{Z}_\text{C}$ and the voltage sources $\vec{v}_0$, the same for the currents.
As we are not interested in the input/output-relation of these passive antennas, a port reduction is performed.
For the port reduction, the coupling matrix $\mat{Z}_\text{C}$ can be represented by four submatrices
\begin{equation}
\mat{Z}_\text{C}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mat{Z}_\text{OO} & \mat{Z}_\text{OL}\\
\mat{Z}_\text{LO} & \mat{Z}_\text{LL}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
so that we get the system relations

\begin{align}
\label{eq:ocl_matrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{v}_\text{CO} \\
\vec{v}_\text{CL}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mat{Z}_\text{OO} & \mat{Z}_\text{OL}\\
\mat{Z}_\text{LO} & \mat{Z}_\text{LL}
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{i}_\text{CO} \\
\vec{i}_\text{CL}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
The index "O" denotes hereby the ports of the required receiver branches, which are open circuited, the index "L" the ports of the non-required receivers and the relays (i.e. the ports with an impedance attached or loaded, respectively).
The indices will change dependent on the user, however without loss of generality, we will derive the port reduction only for user "0" in the following.
We assume, that there are $N_R \cdot N_{Rx}$ antennas, whereby the first $N_{Rx}$ antennas are active (i.e. are the receive antenna of user "0"), and the later ones are passive (i.e. the antennas of the relays and of the other users).
$\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}}$ denotes in the following the $(N_{R}-1)\cdot N_{Rx}$ equivalent input impedances of the non-required receivers and the $N_{Rel}$ impedances representing the relays, placed on the diagonal of a $(N_{R}-1)\cdot N_{Rx}+N_{Rel}$ square matrix.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/Port_reduction.png}
\caption{Port reduction on a network with one load connected to the last port.}
\label{fig:port_reduction}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

From Equation~\eqref{eq:ocl_matrix} and the property
\begin{align}
\vec{v}_\text{CL} &= \vec{v}_0[N_{Rx}+1:N_R\cdot N_{Rx}]-\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}}\cdot\vec{i}_\text{CL}\quad\text{it follows,}\\
\vec{i}_\text{CL} &= -(\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}} + \mat{Z}_\text{LL})^{-1}\mat{Z}_\text{LO}\cdot\vec{i}_\text{CO} -\\\nonumber
&\qquad (\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}} + \mat{Z}_\text{LL})^{-1}\cdot\vec{v}_{0}[N_i+1:N_R]\\\nonumber\quad\text{and therefore,}&\\
\vec{v}_\text{CO} &= (\mat{Z}_\text{OO}-\mat{Z}_\text{OL}(\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}} + \mat{Z}_\text{LL})^{-1}\mat{Z}_\text{LO})\cdot\vec{i}_\text{CO} -\\\nonumber&\qquad \mat{Z}_\text{OL}(\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}} + \mat{Z}_\text{LL})^{-1}\cdot\vec{v}_0[N_{Rx}+1:N_R\cdot N_{Rx}].
\end{align}
With this port reduction the equivalent coupling matrix and input voltage for user "0" become
\begin{align}
\label{eq:port_reduction}
\mat{Z}_\text{C}^{'}&= \mat{Z}_\text{OO} - \mat{Z}_\text{OL}(\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}} + \mat{Z}_\text{LL})^{-1}\mat{Z}_\text{LO}\quad\text{and}\\
\vec{v}_0^{'} &= \mat{H}_0^{\text{pr}} \cdot\mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}}\cdot \vec{v_0}\\\nonumber
&\text{with}\quad\mat{H}_0^{\text{pr}}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mat{I}_{N_i} & -\mat{Z}_\text{OL}(\mat{Z}_{\text{pass}} + \mat{Z}_\text{LL})^{-1}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align}
and so we can reduce the system shown in Figure~\ref{fig:receiver}, to a simpler system which only considers the branches of the receiving antenna.











\subsection{Transfer Function of the Receiver}
\label{sec:transf}
The main interest lies in the transfer function of the input voltages $\vec{v}_0$ (without loss of generality we assume user "0" to be the transmitter) to the voltage measured at the loads (in Figure~\ref{fig:receiver}) $\vec{v}_\text{L}$.

In the following the transfer function over each block of the receiver will be derived.
We use the termination: $\vec{v}_i$ is the voltage on the left of the block $i$ (i.e. $v_\text{M}$ is the voltage on the left ports of the matching network).
Additionally, we see the left ports as input ports and the right ports as output ports of each block.
For the derivation of the transfer function we need four equivalent impedance matrices, namely
\begin{enumerate}
\item{$\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1}$, the impedance matrix looking from the left into the matching network,}
\item{$\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_2}$, the impedance matrix looking from the right into the matching network,}
\item{$\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}$, the impedance matrix looking from the left into the LNA, and}
\item{$\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_2}$, the impedance matrix looking from the right into the LNA.}
\end{enumerate}

To calculate $\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1}$ and $\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}$, we use Equation~\eqref{eq:eq_imp_load} and get the following
\begin{align}
\label{eq:zeqm1}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1} &= \mat{Z}_\text{M11} - \mat{Z}_\text{M21}\cdot(\mat{Z}_\text{M22} + \mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1})^{-1}\cdot\mat{Z}_\text{M12},\\
\label{eq:zeqlna1}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1} &= \mat{c} - \mat{e}\cdot(R_L\mat{I}_{N_R} + \mat{g})^{-1}\cdot\mat{d} = \mat{c}.
\end{align}

As we step through the receiver blocks from left to right, we always have the parallel voltages applied to each receiver block on the left.
Therefore the equivalent input impedances $\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_2}$ and $\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_2}$ can be derived using Equation~\eqref{eq:eq_imp_oc} and lead to the following
\begin{align}
\label{eq:zeqm2}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_2} &= \mat{Z}_\text{M22} - \mat{Z}_\text{M12}\cdot(\mat{Z}_\text{M11})^{-1}\cdot\mat{Z}_\text{M21},\\
\label{eq:zeqlna2}
\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_2} &= \mat{g} - \mat{d}\cdot(\mat{c})^{-1}\cdot\mat{e} = \mat{g}.
\end{align}

To get the parallel input voltage on the left of the matching network, we use the principle of a voltage divider as
\begin{equation}
\vec{v_M} = \mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1}\cdot(\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1} + \mat{Z}_\text{C})^{-1} \mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}}\cdot \vec{v_0}
\end{equation}

To transfer the voltages from the left ports to the right ports of each block we proceed for each block in the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Calculate the input currents,}
\item{transfer the input currents to the output voltages in series, and}
\item{calculate the output voltages in parallel, by a voltage divider.}
\end{enumerate}
For the matching network, it follows:
\begin{align}
\vec{i_M} &= \mat{Z}_\text{M11}^{-1}\cdot\vec{v_M},\\
\vec{v}_{\text{LNA}_\text{series}} &= \mat{Z}_\text{M12}\cdot\vec{i_M} = \mat{Z}_\text{M12} \mat{Z}_\text{M11}^{-1}\cdot\vec{v_M},\\
\vec{v}_\text{LNA} &= \mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}(\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}+\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_2})^{-1}\cdot\vec{v}_{\text{LNA}_\text{series}}\\\nonumber
&=\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}(\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}+\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_2})^{-1}\mat{Z}_\text{M12} \mat{Z}_\text{M11}^{-1}\cdot\vec{v}_\text{M},
\end{align}
and equivalent for the LNA block
\begin{align}
\vec{v_{L}}&=R_L\mat{I}_{N_R}(R_L\mat{I}_{N_R}+\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_2})^{-1}\mat{e}\cdot\mat{c}^{-1}\cdot\vec{v}_\text{LNA}.
\end{align}
Therefore we have three transfer functions to characterize our system.
Denoting the transfer function form voltage $\vec{v}_j$ to voltage $\vec{v}_i$ as $\mat{H}_{i,j}$ (i.e. $\vec{v}_i = \mat{H}_{i,j} \cdot\vec{v}_j$), it follows
\begin{align}
\mat{H}_\text{M,0'} &= \mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1}\cdot(\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_1} + \mat{Z}_\text{C})^{-1}, \\
\mat{H}_\text{LNA,M} &= \mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}(\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_1}+\mat{Z}_{\text{eqM}_2})^{-1}\mat{Z}_\text{M12} \mat{Z}_\text{M11}^{-1},\quad\text{and}\\
\mat{H}_\text{L,LNA} &= R_L\mat{I}_{N_R}(R_L\mat{I}_{N_R}+\mat{Z}_{\text{eqLNA}_2})^{-1}\mat{e}\cdot\mat{c}^{-1}.
\end{align}

And the overall transferfunction
\begin{align}
\label{eq:transf_func}
\mat{H}_\text{L,0'} &= \mat{H}_\text{L,LNA}\cdot\mat{H}_\text{LNA,M}\cdot\mat{H}_\text{M,0'}.
\end{align}



\subsection{Signal Covariance Matrix}
\label{sec:sig_cov}
To calculate the achievable sum rate of the systems (c.f. Section~\ref{sec:rates}), we need to derive the signal covariance matrix, defined as $\mathbb{E}[\vec{v}_\text{L}^s\vec{v}_\text{L}^{s^H}]$.

We assume without loss of generality, that transmitter "0" is the corresponding partner of receiver "0".
The overall transfer functions from $\vec{v}_0$ to $\vec{v}_\text{L}^s$ therefore can be extended from Equation~\eqref{eq:transf_func} to
\begin{align}
\label{eq:transfer_function}
 \vec{v}_\text{L}^s&= \mat{H}_\text{L,LNA}\cdot\mat{H}_\text{LNA,M}\cdot\mat{H}_\text{M,0'}
		\cdot \mat{H}_0^{\text{pr}}\cdot\mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}} \cdot\vec{v}_0,\\\nonumber
 &=\mat{H}_\text{L,0}\cdot \mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}}\cdot\vec{v}_0,
\end{align}
and hence the signal covariance matrix becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sig_cov}
\mat{K}_{\text{s},0}=\mathbb{E}[\vec{v}_\text{L}^s\vec{v}_\text{L}^{s^H}] = 
	\mat{H}_\text{L,0}\cdot \mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}}
	\cdot\mathbb{E}[\vec{v}_0\vec{v}_0^H]\cdot
	\mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}^H} \cdot \mat{H}_\text{L,0}^H,
\end{equation}
where $\mat{H}_\text{L,0}$ is the transfer function including any port reduction at the receiver and $\mat{H}_{0}^{\text{sp}}$ the transferfunction over the spatial channel derived in Equation~\eqref{eq:spatial_channel} for transmitter "0".

\subsection{Interference Covariance Matrix}
\label{sec:int_cov}

To calculate the interference covariance matrix, all the signal sources besides the partner (in this case, all but "0") have to be consider.
This means, that all signal parts arriving at the loads of receiver "0" must be summed up over all the interferer.

The interference covariance matrix hence becomes 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:interf_cov}\nonumber
\mat{K}_{\text{i},0}=\mathbb{E}[\vec{v}_\text{L}^i\vec{v}_\text{L}^{i^H}] &= \sum_{j=1}^{N_\text{User}-1} 
	\mat{H}_\text{L,0} \cdot \mat{H}_{j}^{\text{sp}} \cdot 
	\mathbb{E}[\vec{v}_{j}\vec{v}_{j}^H] \cdot 
	\mat{H}_{j}^{\text{sp}^H} \cdot \mat{H}_\text{L,0}^H,\\
	&= \mat{H}_\text{L,0} \left(\sum_{j=1}^{N_\text{User}-1} 
	\cdot \mat{H}_{j}^{\text{sp}} \cdot 
	\mathbb{E}[\vec{v}_{j}\vec{v}_{j}^H] \cdot 
	\mat{H}_{j}^{\text{sp}^H}\right) \cdot \mat{H}_\text{L,0}^H.
\end{align}


%% Noise part
\input{chapters/noise_description}


\section{Rate Calculations}
\label{sec:rates}

\subsection{Achievable Rate}
\label{sec:achiev_rate}
After the derivation of the signal, interference and noise covariance matrix, we can now describe the achievable rate for each connection pair.
The achievable rate for user $j$ is described as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:achiev_rate}
\nonumber
r_j &= \text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{s},j}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{i},j}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},j}\right)^{-1}+\mat{I}_{N_R}\right)\right)\\
 &=\text{log}_2\left(
	\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{s},j}+
		\mat{K}_{\text{i},j}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},j}\right)\right) -
	\text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{i},j}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},j}\right)\right).
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\label{eq:achiev_rate}
r_0 &= \text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{s},0}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{i},0}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},0}\right)^{-1}+\mat{I}_{N_R}\right)\right)\\
 &=\text{log}_2\left(
	\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{s},0}+
		\mat{K}_{\text{i},0}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},0}\right)\right) -
	\text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{i},0}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},0}\right)\right).
\end{align}

Stacking the achievable rates per user into a vector, leads to 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:achiev_vec}
\vec{r} =
\begin{bmatrix}
r_0 & r_1 & \cdots & r_{N_\text{User}-1}
\end{bmatrix}^T.
\end{equation}

And by this vector we can describe the achievable sum rate as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:achiev_sum_rate}
r_\text{Sum} = ||\vec{r}||_1,
\end{equation}
with $||\cdot||_1$ the 1-norm, i.e. the sum of the elements of $\vec{r}$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:achiev_sum_rate}
\max_{\mat{Z}_\text{M}}\left(r_\text{Sum}\right) = \max_{\mat{Z}_\text{M}}\left(\sum_{j=0}^{N_\text{User}-1} r[j]\right),
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interference Limited Rate}
\label{sec:sir_rate}
Another measure required in this thesis is the interference limited rate.
It is calculated by only considering the signal and interference.
Therefore neglecting the noise in Equation~\ref{eq:achiev_rate} leads to
\begin{align}
\label{eq:sir_rate}
r_j &=\text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{s},j}+\mat{K}_{\text{i},j}\right)\right) -
	     	\text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{i},j}\right)\right).
\end{align}

This is helpful, to see how good the interference was removed by the optimization, which will be introduced in Chapter~\ref{sec:solver}.



\subsection{TDMA Rate}
\label{sec:tdma_rate}
In the later sections the results achieved in this thesis will be compared to existing protocols eliminating interference, such as TDMA.
Therefore in the following the the achievable rates for the TDMA protocol will be shown.

As the time in TDMA is split up in slots in which each user is allowed to transmit without any interference, the achievable rate from Equation~\eqref{eq:achiev_rate} reduces to the interference free achievable rate of 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:tdma_achiev_rate}
r_j  &=\frac{1}{N_\text{User}}\cdot\left(
		\text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{s},j}+\mat{K}_{\text{n},j}\right)\right) -
	     	\text{log}_2\left(\text{det}\left(\mat{K}_{\text{n},j}\right)\right)\right).
\end{align}
It is obvious, that with no interference, this rate would be higher than the achievable rate with interference, if the factor of $\frac{1}{N_\text{User}}$ was not considered.
However each user is not allowed anymore, to use the full transmission period, but only a time slot of length $\frac{1}{N_\text{User}}\cdot T_0$, with $T_0$ the length of the full transmission period.
Therefore the achievable sum rate can be written as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:tdma_achiev_sum_rate}
\nonumber
r_\text{Sum} &= ||\vec{r}||_1,\\
&= \frac{1}{N_\text{User}}\cdot \sum_{j=0}^{N_\text{User}-1} r_j.
\end{align}
The term $\frac{1}{N_\text{User}}$ is hereby called "pre-log" factor and the reason why TDMA is not a good approach for a large number of users, as $N_\text{User}$ increases linearly, however the advantage of an interference free link will only increase the rate logarithmically over a low interference connection.

There are different approaches of using TDMA, such as allowing a small number of users at the same time to transmit during one time slot.
This will lead to some interference but therefore also a smaller pre-log factor.
Such an approach is used in the later chapters.
